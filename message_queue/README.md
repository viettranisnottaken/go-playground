## Possible Next Steps
1. Message Acknowledgment
   - Keep track of message states (unacknowledged, acknowledged, etc.).
   - Handle re-delivery if a consumer fails to process.

2. Persistent Storage
   - Store messages on disk (or in a database) for reliability.
   - This would require more complex read/write logic and a persistence layer.

3. Multiple Queues / Topics
   - Instead of a single queue, the Broker can manage multiple queues (often called “topics” or “exchanges”).
   - Each producer can specify which queue (topic) it’s publishing to.
   - Each consumer listens to one or more queues.

4. Routing / Filtering
   - When you have multiple queues, you might want routing rules (e.g., “send messages with type X to queue A, type Y to queue B”).

5. Backpressure and Rate Limiting
   - If producers are publishing faster than consumers can handle, you need a strategy to avoid memory bloat and system overload.

6. Cluster Setup
   - For a real production system, you’d look into distributing queues across multiple servers and ensuring data replication or consistent hashing to scale horizontally.
